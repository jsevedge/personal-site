I recently got back to Seattle after spending a month in San Diego with my family.  I wanted to talk a bit about the experience and some of the resources and tips I picked up along the way.

## Influence

There were two main influences that made me want to spend a month each year in a different city, in the US and eventually abroad.

- Anything Tim Ferris does is excellent, especially the Tim Ferriss Show podcast, but a specific talk he gave back in 2007 at SXSW stood out to me which you can find in this [episode](https://tim.blog/2021/11/21/sxsw-presentation-2007-the-4-hour-workweek-transcript/).  In the presentation Tim talks about lifestyle design and his own journey through 20+ countries and the joy that brought him.  I am not interested in a full-time digital nomad lifestle as that is not feasible for me right now given our kids and life revolving around family and friends, but it did spark the idea of non conventional ways to explore the country and beyond.
- During my time working at F5 I have had the pleasure of working with fantastic colleagues and learned a lot both technically and in horizon broadening.  One of the most valuable things I learned was simply watching and talking with those around me that I looked up to and observed how they spent their time.  I noticed a few people who would spend 3-4 weeks at a time in a different city or country and spend time on hobbies with family and friends.  Usually while working part time each week to avoid burning too much PTO time and ensure they were available to the business for critical needs and worked on projects that were not team dependent.

## Planning

Once I decided I wanted to implement this lifestyle design goal, and had talked it over with my wife, I started to look at options for where to go and how to do it affordably.  During my research I compiled a few options.

- Booking a place using AirBnb still offers the most inventory and the best search user experience.  Pro tip, at least in the US, if you pick a place with a monthly rate and select at least 30 nights you will not have to pay any occupancy tax.  Additionally if you find a place with a monthly rate that is 10-20% above budget you may have luck with messaging the host and asking for a custom rate.  For me personally I only did this once absolutely sure the place was a good fit and was ready to pull the trigger to avoid spamming and wasting the potential hosts time.  It worked for me, but YMMV.
- Although not exactly the type of service to match what I was looking for if you are considering the digital nomad lifestyle keep an eye on services like [Blueground](https://www.theblueground.com), [Anyplace](https://www.anyplace.com/digital-nomad-housing) and [Oasis](https://www.oasiscollections.com/promo/oasis-passport).  Personally I would like to see these services evolve to include a business model that accomodates part-time digital nomads with a plan similar to a seasonal boat club membership.
- If you happen to own a property, especially one in a location with plenty of tourists, an unconventional approach I considered was [HomeExchange](https://www.homeexchange.com).  This really depends on your comfort level with people being in your home and makes planning for which destination and dates more of an opportunistic approach as you will need to find a home swap match.

## Trip

With our kids being 4 and 6 it was easy to decide on San Diego as our initial destination given all the things to do in the area including the San Diego Zoo, Safari Park, SeaWorld, LegoLand, beaches, parks and water parks.  Given it was on the west coast we decided to take our first road trip in the Model Y and that ended up being a blast since we were able to take our time and stop off in Sacramento and Santa Monica on the way there and Santa Barbara and San Francisco on the way back.

I decided to take Monday and Friday off each week which gave us extra time each week and we used those two days for the big activities and filled in the rest of the week to maximize fun and minimize burnout.

Here are some pictures from the trip!

## Insights

The whole family had a wonderful time in San Diego and I would vie the city a 10/10 in matching and beating expectations.  For future trips especially in locations with less things to do we might look into getting a larger place and asking different friends/family to come in for 5-7 days at a time to give the kids someone to play with and increase the social aspect of the trip.
