Hello, welcome to my personal site where I dabble in cobbling together random words to say at people.

I am a software developer in the Seattle area who enjoys creating software and solving interesting problems in the technology space.  In my free time I enjoy playing basketball (in the summer) or snowboarding (in the winter) with friends, reading and spending time with my beautiful wife and two wonderful kids.
