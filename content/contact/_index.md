**If you would like to reach out to me, please do.  But read through the following first:**

- If you have a technical question, don't be lazy!  Research until you are certain the answer is not presenting itself to you.  Resources such as Google and Stack Overflow are great.
- Please be polite, I will do my best to respond and always assume positive intent.
